# Query Language Manager (QLM)

Query Language Manager (QLM) is a streamlined tool that leverages artificial intelligence to generate SQL queries from natural language prompts. It provides a user-friendly interface for efficient database management, catering to both novice users and experienced database administrators.

## Introduction

In the realm of data management, SQL queries are fundamental for interacting with databases. However, constructing these queries often requires a solid understanding of SQL syntax, which can be a barrier for non-technical users. QLM addresses this challenge by integrating a powerful AI model that interprets plain English prompts and converts them into precise SQL commands.

## Features

- **AI-Powered Query Generation**: Utilizes Google's generative AI model to translate natural language prompts into SQL queries.
  
- **Database Management**: Connects seamlessly to MySQL databases, executes generated queries, and displays results in real-time.
  
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Built with Streamlit, QLM provides an intuitive interface for users to input prompts, view generated SQL, and manage database interactions effortlessly.
  
- **Logging and Monitoring**: Comprehensive logging ensures transparency and allows users to track executed queries and system activities.
  
- **Customizable Safety Settings**: Includes safety settings to control content generation based on specific categories like dangerous content or hate speech.

# Query Language Manager (QLM) Usage Guide

## 1. Installation

### Clone the Repository

Clone the QLM repository from GitHub using the command:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/AyonSOMADDAR/Query-Language-Manager-QLM-.git
cd Query-Language-Manager-QLM-
```

### Install Dependencies

Navigate to the cloned repository folder and install the required Python dependencies using pip:
